 # My own reflection on this project
 This was a school project for our MEAN course. It served as the final project of this course in which we needed to demonstrate all the skills we have.I'll have to admit that there are a few odd solutions that i used such as connecting to the databse a few times since I used mongoose for some functions (like the login) and Mongoclient for others. This was due to that we used some tutorials in our course and due to a pretty strict timetable about 2-3 weeks I used all the info I had learned from those tutorials, thats why the odd solutions.
 
 Overall I feel I did fine, now i just got start learning more about MEAN stack, and also fix this app once i have the time...
